# RPS_Battle_Express_Edition
 
In the earlier weeks of the Makers course, we created a web app in which the user could play a game of Rock Paper Scissors. We wrote it in Ruby and used Sinatra as a framework. 
 
To continue developing my skills having finished the course, I have written a Rock, Paper Scissors game using JavaScript and Express as a framework. The goal of this project is to learn how to create a back end with Express and to make an interactive game the user can play in their browser.

Here's the result!
